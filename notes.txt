"Josefin Sans", sans-serif

1) gaps :-
-> gaps should be consistent across different section of the page
-> both vertical and horizontal
-> it is goood idea to have 2 divs just wrapping the entire page . (media queries)

2) colors - do not use many colors on the page, 1-3 colors are enough for standard input and other components

3) use a font that macthes with the theme / emotion you want to convey for your site. if this is difficult use a standard font like 
   roboto, seoge ui, monsterrat, verdana, lato etc
   -> do nt use more than two or three fonts on the website.
   -> standardize font sizes for headings and paragraph text.
